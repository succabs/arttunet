      <h1>Who is he?</h1>

      <p>
        You can find all the work-related details on the other pages, so hereâ€™s something different â€” a peek into who I am outside of code. Also featuring a couple of rare photos from across the timeline of Arttuâ„¢.
      </p>
      
      <h2>ðŸŽ§ Hobbies & Interests</h2>
      
      <p>
        I have a lot of hobbies. The latest is DJ'ing â€” I picked it up in March 2025, so I'm still learning, but it's a great way to get into flow and disconnect from daily noise. I'm slowly building a library focused on DnB and psytrance.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        During summer, I enjoy magnet fishing. Itâ€™s like a low-effort treasure hunt â€” surprisingly fun with friends on a sunny day.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I love books, movies, and shows â€” mostly sci-fi, thrillers, and anime. I also play guitar, not as actively these days, but it's still there when the mood hits.
      </p>

      <p>I also do hiking, puzzles, jogging - you name it. It's hard to find time to do everything, but I enjoy a lot of things.</p>

      <h2>ðŸ§  Tech & Tinkering</h2>
      
      <p>
        I started coding young â€” back when table layouts ruled the web and websites had flashing marquee tags. My first sites were in pure HTML & CSS, and I made simple games with CoolBasic. I'm kind of sad that none of these survived the time and
        are now all gone.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I'm fascinated by the history of tech. Why did VHS beat Betamax? What caused the downfall of Symbian? These stories are like little windows into how people and systems work â€” and either succeed or fail.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Iâ€™ve used different OS's, run a home Linux server, and started way too many side projects I never finished. They are mostly based on a humorous idea and when the idea is not fun anymore, the project gets shelved.

        <figcaption>Iâ€™ve liked technology since I was born. Here's me and my first mobile phone. A perfect Christmas gift.</figcaption>

      <h2>ðŸ§­ What I Value</h2>
      
      <p>
        I believe in curiosity, weird ideas, and learning by doing. I enjoy figuring out how things work â€” not just in tech, but in people, systems, and stories.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I like people who are genuinely into things â€” whether itâ€™s tech, insects, jazz, or potato taxonomy. Passion is cool, whatever form it takes.
