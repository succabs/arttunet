    Hi, I'm Arttu Nikkilä — a web developer based in Finland with a passion for crafting beautiful websites and getting analytics data right.
  </p>

  <p>
    My work focuses on Shopify development, combining hands-on theme dev with integrations involving Liquid, JavaScript, React, GraphQL, and more. I specialize in bridging the gap between development and real-world business goals, especially in the eCommerce space.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm also the go-to person for analytics setups: from GA4 to GTM, web pixels to Piwik, I make sure tracking works, no matter the platform or stack.
  </p>

  <p>
    At Woolman, I’ve handled projects solo from start to finish — owning both the frontend and tracking side. And yeah, I lean on tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot as part of my workflow (because why not make life easier?).
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of tech, I like to balance things out. You’ll often find me playing guitar, reading science fiction, or going magnet fishing (yes, that’s a thing — and it's surprisingly addictive). I’m also into obscure rabbit holes, which means I probably know way too much about something totally useless.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're here to check out my projects, learn what tools I use, or just curious what “Plagiointisyytös” means in a student game context — welcome! Hope you enjoy your stay :)
